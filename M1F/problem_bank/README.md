# M1F Problem Bank.

M1F is a course given to first year undergraduates at Imperial College London.
This problem bank is a collection of M1F problems from old problem sheets.
Our aim is questions and solutions in TeX, pdf and lean format.

# What is Lean format?

The lean files are the questions and solutions to the various problems, in
 format which is readable by the computer proof verification software "Lean". 
Lean is a growing piece of software and sometimes changes in Lean mean
that stuff which used to compile now no longer does. All these files
should compile with "Xena's Standard Lean V1", which
is Lean and Mathlib on Christmas Day 2017.
